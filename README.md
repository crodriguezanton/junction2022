# DataRing

Your data, your power. 

We believe that all the data you are producing in the hundreds and applications that you use should be your property and thus let you leverage your data by monetizing it.


## Description


We are giving users back ownership of their data that usually only gets holded by intermediaries and big tech.

You can explore services that you're using and you can reclaim your data from. Then, you can get all the available information of those services in your own premises (you control the hosting of your data).
The process of connecting all the data is automated by seamless plugins that allow to control the data and the scopes that you can import. You can get many data insights from that data and, moreover, you can monetize your data by selling it directly to the people that would be using it, taking your fair part.

All of this is done using blockchain technology and smart contracts that allow to be completely auditable. We leverage streamr network to store the data securely and decentralized.
